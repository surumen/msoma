                    	<span id="highlight-text"><a href="index.html#slide02">Flipped Classroom</a></span>
                        <p>The bootcamp is an intensive and immersive four-week program designed to prepare beginners who have never done any programming to kick start a career in computer science. We apply a "flipped classroom" model where there are no lectures - just workshops and labs. You access workshop material before the day of instruction and work on projects during sessions.</p>

                        <span id="highlight-text"><a href="index.html#slide05">Daily Schedule</a></span>
                        <p>There is one workshop in the morning, and two labs in the afternoon from Monday to Friday. Workshops are two hours long, with a break in between. On some days, there will be special guests we invite to inspire you with their work. Each labs is one and a half hour long. During labs, you work on individual projects with the help of our instructors and your peers.</p>

                    	<span id="highlight-text"><a href="index.html#slide04">Courses </a></span>
                        <p>Our courses are designed to give you the confidence and skills you need to be a great programmer. We cover courses ranging from Intro to Programming (taught in Python) to Web Development and Design Thinking. We also incorporate an ethics course to challenge you to think consciously about the social implications of using and developing technology.</p>
                        <span id="highlight-text"><a href="index.html#slide06">What Happens Next?</a></span>
                        <p>Once you're admitted into the bootcamp, you become an M-Soma fellow forever. Scholars who wish to apply to colleges outside Kenya would get mentorship and advice on the application process from our committed community of mentors. Those who wish to venture into different paths will also be matched with mentors with similar interests.</p>

Our programming course is not meant to teach any programming language, but rather to prepare you to be a great programmer who can easily pick up any programming language thereafter</p>
