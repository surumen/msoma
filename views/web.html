                <p>The demand for learning web programming is at an all time high, but for most people the process at times seems intimidating and difficult. This course will simplify everything and give you the confidence to design and develop websites in less than two hours. Nothing beats an in-person class with passionate mentors and instructors and stimulating handson projects.
                    <br> The first portion of this course will teach you how to build websites using HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript. You will also identify, compare, and critic design practices in popular websites. Every detail from programming projects and workshop material is carefully chosen to provide the best possible learning experience for you.
                    <br>
                    <br> The second portion of this course introduces you to building the back-end to make your website <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">dynamic</span> using the Ruby on Rails framework. You will learn to implement functionalities like logging in and sign up for your website users, creating mailers to your website users, and hiding some things from users who are signed up.</p>
