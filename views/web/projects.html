    Every detail in these projects is chosen carefully to ensure that you've mastered the content covered during all workshops for that week.<br> Projects are due Wednesday the following week. All projects must be done individually, except with the help of the M-Soma instructors and mentors. If you use code snippets that you did not write yourself, you must credit the author appropriately.<br>While we encourage collaboration, there are limits such as not showing or sharing your code to someone else in any form.
