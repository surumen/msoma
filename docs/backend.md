## `database`

### `datamodel`

Type definitions in GraphQL SDL for our database. These types are roughly translated as SQL tables by Prisma.

### `prisma.yml`

Prisma configuration file. Learn more about it [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/service-configuration/prisma.yml/overview-and-example-foatho8aip).

### `seed.graphql`

Initial values that will be loaded in our database by Prisma.

## `src`

### `directives`

GraphQL schema directives can be defined in this directory. We use them for authentication.

### `errors`

Custom error definitions can be placed here. They should all inherit the default `ApolloError` provided in order to keep consistency.

### `generated`

This folder will contain all the GraphQL generated schema. Specifically, our database schema generated by Prisma will be downloaded here and will be consumed by `prisma-bindings`.

### `middleware`

Express.js middleware is located here. Middleware runs right after a request is received and before GraphQL resolvers start. It is a good place to check authentication tokens.

### `resolvers`

Contains all the resolvers for queries, mutations and subscriptions.

### `schema`

Our **server's API definition** (not our database!) lives here in shape of GraphQL SDL. We separate every GraphQL entity in a different file: types, directives, inputs, scalars, etc. The `index.graphql` will contain the queries and mutations.

### `utils`

Several utility functions.

### `db.js`

Exports the database connection object that can be used in resolvers or any other service.

### `apollo-server.js`

Manages configurations specific to `apollo-server` (or `apollo-server-express`) such as subscriptions, mocks, Apollo engine, etc.

### `index.js`

Main entry point of our server. Connects all the previous pieces and starts the HTTP server.

## `.graphqlconfig.yml`

Configuration for our GraphQL development environment. More info [here](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-config).
